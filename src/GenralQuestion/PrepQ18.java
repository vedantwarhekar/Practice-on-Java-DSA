/*
Friendly Pair
The numbers whose ( sum of divisors ) / number ratio is same are known as 
Friendly Pair Numbers.
Let's try and understand it better using an example

Example
Input : 6 28
Output : Yes, they are a friendly pair
Explanation : The factors of 6 and 28 except the numbers themselves are 1, 2, 3 
and 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 respectively.
Now the sum of factors of both the numbers are 6 and 28 respectively. 
When we divide the sums with the numbers we get 1 and 1 respectively. 
As the ratio of both the number match, they are considered as a friendly pair.
Therefore, from the above mentioned definition and example, we'll check for
 friendly pairs.
